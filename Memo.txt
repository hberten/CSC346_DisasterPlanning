The estimated populations from the database seem to in general vary approximately 5% from US census data, though in the case of smaller towns (with populations in the hundreds), the deviation from the census is much larger. Generally, with smaller populations, the displayed data tends to be larger. The data on the total number of households varies much more from census data, with there tending to be a larger number of households listed. This is likely because the method of measuring it is not the most accurate, as it currently judges based off of the number of tax returns filed, which can be larger when independents live with their parents. The database used had various "locationtype"'s, so I only used "PRIMARY" locations that are not "decommissioned."
